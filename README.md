# GettingAndCleaningDataFinalProject

The project is about cleaning a dataset distribuited in different .txt archives.

It is composed by a diversity of steps, which are:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. Create a second, independent tidy data set, based on step 4, with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The folder data has to be in the folder where the working directory is.
